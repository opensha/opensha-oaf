# This is a set of options for selecting the AAFS configuration.
# For most applications, the entire AAFS installation can be confgured
# from the information in this file.  Edit it to select your configuration.

# This file should be named oaf_config.sh and it should be placed either
# in your home directory or else in the directory where the aoaf.sh script
# is located (typically ~/opensha).  This file is sourced by the quick
# install script aoaf.sh, which looks first in the current directory
# and then in the home directory.

# You can use the following command to download this file from Github:
# wget https://github.com/opensha/opensha-oaf/raw/master/deployment/scripts/oaf_config.sh

# You can use these commands to download the script aoaf.h from Github:
# wget https://github.com/opensha/opensha-oaf/raw/master/deployment/scripts/aoaf.sh
# chmod 755 aoaf.sh




# Edit the values below.
#
# Each value should appear immediately after the equals sign with no
# intervening spaces.  A value can be left blank my putting nothing after
# the equals sign.  Generally, each value should be enclosed in double
# quotes; the quotes themselves are not part of the value.  Since this
# is a bash script file, any value valid in bash can be used.
