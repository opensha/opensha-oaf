        <h2>Entering Date and Time</h2>
        <p>
            When entering a date and time into the GUI, the recommended format is &quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&quot;.
            For example, &quot;2025-04-14 17:08&quot;. Times are always UTC.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the GUI accepts a variety of date and time formats.
            The date and time consists of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, in that order.
            The year must be given as four digits; the others can be given as one or two digits.
            The second is optional. If included, the second can have a decimal part.
            Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recommended format: 2025-04-14 17:08</li>
            <li>With seconds: 2025-04-14 17:08:28</li>
            <li>With milliseconds: 2025-04-14 17:08:28.275</li>
            <li>Leading zero suppression: 2025-4-14 17:8</li>
            <li>ISO-8601 format: 2025-04-14T17:08:28Z</li>
            <li>Space or tab delimited: 2025 04 14 17 08</li>
            <li>Slash delimited zero suppressed date: 2025/4/14 17:08</li>

            <li>Dot delimited date and time: 2025.04.14 17.08.28</li>
        </ul>
