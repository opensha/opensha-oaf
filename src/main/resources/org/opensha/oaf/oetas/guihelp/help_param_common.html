        <h2>Edit Common Parameters</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you set parameters that are common to both Reasendberg-Jones and ETAS forecasts..
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Apply time-dependent Mc<br>F<br>G<br>H<br>Mcat</b></p>
        <p>
            These controls let you select a time-dependent magnitude of completeness,
            according to the Helmstetter model.
            You can also select a time-independent magnitude of completeness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>H</b> fields contain the three Helmstetter parameters.
            The <b>Mcat</b> field contains the catalog magnitude of completeness during &quot;normal&quot; times.
        </p>
        <p>
            You use the drop-down to select the magnitude of completeness model you want to use.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Enable</i> - Enables the use of a Helmstetter time-dependent incompleteness model.
                You need to enter the desired Helmstetter parameters into <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>H</b>,
                and you need to supply the catalog magnitude of completeness in <b>Mcat</b>.
                Note that, by convention, setting <b>G</b> equal to 100.0 produces a time-independent
                magnitude of completeness equal to the value of <b>Mcat</b>.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>World Values</i> - Enables the use of a Helmstetter time-dependent incompleteness model
                with standard values for the world catalog.
                The <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>H</b> fields are deactivated and set equal to the world values.
                You need to supply the catalog magnitude of completeness in <b>Mcat</b>.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>California Values</i> - Enables the use of a Helmstetter time-dependent incompleteness model
                with standard values for the California catalog.
                The <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>H</b> fields are deactivated and set equal to the California values.
                You need to supply the catalog magnitude of completeness in <b>Mcat</b>.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Constant - Mcat</i> - Selects a constant time-independent magnitude of completeness
                equal to the value of <b>Mcat</b>.
                The <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>H</b> fields are deactivated, and <b>G</b> is set equal to 100.0.
                You need to supply the catalog magnitude of completeness in <b>Mcat</b>.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Constant - Mc</i> - Selects a constant time-independent magnitude of completeness
                equal to the value of <b>Mc</b> (which is described below).
                The <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>H</b> fields are deactivated, and <b>G</b> is set equal to 100.0.
                You need to supply the catalog magnitude of completeness in <b>Mc</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Mc</b></p>
        <p>
            The estimated magnitude of completeness for the catalog that has been loaded into the GUI.
            When a catalog is loaded, the GUI initializes this field by applying a maximum curvature
            algorithm to the catalog.
            You can edit this value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>b</b></p>
        <p>
            The Gutenberg-Richter b-value.
            When a catalog is loaded, the GUI initializes this field to a pre-programmed value
            (or to a value used in a prior forecast).
            The initial value is likely to be 1.0.
            You can edit this value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Tools for Mc and b-value<br>Run tool for Mc and b-value</b></p>
        <p>
            These controls provide access to tools for analyzing the loaded catalog and
            estimating the magnitude of completeness or b-value.
            You select the tool you want from the drop-down, and then press the button
            to launch the tool, which will open in a sub-panel.
            There are currently two tools available:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Max Likelihood b</i> - Estimates b-value by applying a maximim likelihood algorithm.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>b-Positive</i> - Estimates b-value by applying the b-positive algorithm.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Fit Start Inset<br>Fit End Inset</b></p>
        <p>
            By default, parameter fitting is done using all aftershocks from just after the
            mainshock until the end of the catalog.
            This time range is called the fitting interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, you may want to shrink the fitting interval, so you don&#39;t use all those aftershocks.
            For example, if the sequence seems to change character at some point in time,
            you may want parameter fitting to start at that time instead of at the time of the mainshock.
            Or, if the latter part of catalog is inaccurate due to delays in processing seismic data,
            you may want parameter fitting to end some time before the end of the catalog.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Fit Start Inset</b> field specifies the start of the fitting interval,
            expressed as days after the mainshock.
            The <b>Fit End Inset</b> field specifies the end of the fitting interval,
            expressed as days before the end of the catalog.
            Thus, setting both fields to 0.0 yields the default fitting interval.
        </p>

        <p><b>Forecast Magnitude Bins</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down selects the set of magnitude bins that appear in the forecast table.
