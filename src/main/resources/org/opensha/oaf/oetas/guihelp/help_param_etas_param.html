        <h2>Edit ETAS Parameters</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you set the parameter ranges for the ETAS search grid.
            The total number of points in the search grid is limited to a maximum of 5,000,000.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS n Range (Log Scale)<br>ETAS n Number<br>ETAS n Skew</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;n&quot; parameter,
            which is the branch ratio of aftershocks.
            The branch ratio has a log scale.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            The skew lets you adjust the distribution of grid points within the range.
            If the skew equals 1.0, then grid points are equally spaced in log-space.
            If the skew is greater then 1.0, then there is a higher density of grid
            points at the upper end of the range.
            For example, the default skew of 3.0 means that grid points are three
            times denser (in log space) at the upper end of the range than at the
            lower end of the range.
            This can be useful because a small change in the branch ratio has
            a greater effect when the branch ratio is large.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maximum value of the branch ratio should be less than 1.0 to
            avoid super-critical behavior.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS p Range (Linear Scale)<br>ETAS p Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;p&quot; parameter,
            which is the Omori exponent.
            The Omori exponent has a linear scale, so the grid points are equally spaced.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS c Range (Log Scale)<br>ETAS c Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;c&quot; parameter,
            which is the Omori offset.
            The Omori offset has a log scale, so the grid points are equally spaced in log-space.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS zams Range (Linear Scale)<br>ETAS zams Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;zams&quot; parameter,
            which is the mainshock and foreshock productivity.
            The mainshock and foreshock productivity has a linear scale, so the grid points are equally spaced.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use relative zams</b></p>
        <p>
            If this box is checked, then the value of &quot;zams&quot; is relative to the branch ratio.
            For example, if &quot;zams&quot; equals zero then the mainshock and foreshocks have the same
            productivity as an aftershock of the same magnitude.
            If &quot;zams&quot; equals 0.5 then the mainshock and foreshocks have about three times as much
            productivity as an aftershock of the same magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the box is not checked, then &quot;zams&quot; is the absolute productivity of the
            mainshock and foreshocks.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS zmu Range (Log Scale)<br>ETAS zmu Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;zmu&quot; parameter,
            which is the background rate.
            The background rate is expressed in units of expected number of magnitude 3
            earthquakes per day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The background rate has a log scale, so the grid points are equally spaced in log-space.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can set a zero background rate by entering 0.0 as the minimum and maximum
            values, and entering 1 for the number.
            If the number is greater than 1, then the background rate must be positive
            (non-zero) because it is on a log scale.
