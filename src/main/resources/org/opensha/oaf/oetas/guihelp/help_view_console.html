        <h2>Console Window</h2>
        <p>
            The console window is located on the right side of the GUI,
            and is accessed by clicking the <b>Console tab</b>.
            The console window is always available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many operations within the GUI write output to the console,
            to report progress or results.
            The console window shows everything written to the console since the GUI was opened.
            New console output is appended at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you launched the GUI from a command line within a terminal window,
            then it is likely that the console output also appears in the terminal window.
