        <h2>Analyst Parameters</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you send a variety of analyst options to the servers.
            The servers remember these options and use them in future forecasts.
            You can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Turn forecasts on or off.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select how long the servers should produce forecasts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter injectable text or an analyst remark.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select whether the servers generate event-sequence products.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select whether the servers should use custom aftershock parameters.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The panel becomes active when you load data into the GUI.
            (If you load data from a catalog file then you need to check the <b>Call Comcat for mainshock</b>
            checkbox in order for this panel to be active.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Except for using custom aftershock parameters, the functions in this panel
            do not require that you fit parameters or compute a forecast;
            all that is needed is a mainshock.
            If you want to use custom aftershock parameters, then you do need to fit
            parameters and compute a forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Automatic Forecasts</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down list tells the servers whether or not they should generate forecasts for the current earthquake.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Normal</i> - Let the servers decide whether or not to generate forecasts using
                the standard algorithm.
                The servers generate forecasts automatically if the earthquake is in a supported region,
                the earthquake&#39;s magnitude is above the magnitude threshold for the region,
                and the earthquake does not appear to be a foreshock or aftershock of a lerger earthquake.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Enable</i> - Tells the servers to generate forecasts for the current earthquake.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Disable</i> - Tells the servers to <b>not</b> generate forecasts for the current earthquake.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Forecast Duration</b></p>
        <p>
            Controls how long the automatic system keeps issuing forecasts, in days since the mainshock.
            The default value of 365 causes the system to issue forecasts for one year after the mainshock.
            You can enter values up to 3650, which is ten years.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Injectable Text</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a dialog box for you to enter injectable text.
            The injectable text appears on the event page for the current earthquake.
            The injectable text cannot contain hyperlinks or any formatting.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Analyst Remark</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a dialog box for you to enter an analyst remark.
            The analyst remark does <b>not</b> appear on the event page for the current earthquake,
            but it can be viewed by opening the download file (forecast_data.json).
            The analyst remark cannot contain any formatting.
            It can contain Internet addresses but they should refer only to highly-reliable pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Caution: Although the analyst remark does not appear on the event page,
            it is visible to the public.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Event-Sequence Option<br>Event Sequence Lookback</b></p>
        <p>
            The drop-down list tells the servers whether or not they should generate event-sequence products
            for the current earthquake.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Auto</i> - Let the servers decide whether or not to generate event-sequence products using
                the standard algorithm.
                By default, the servers generate an event-sequence product whenever they generate a forecast;
                modify or delete the event-sequence product if the forecast is deleted
                (for example, if the current earthquake becomes a foreshock of a later, larger earthquake);
                and let the event-sequence product remain in Comcat after the last forecast is removed.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Update</i> - Tells the servers to generate event-sequence products for the current earthquake.
                Currently, this is essentially the same thing as using the standard algorithm.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Ignore</i> - Tells the servers to <b>not</b> generate, modify, or delete event-sequence products
                for the current earthquake.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Delete</i> - Tells the servers to <b>not</b> generate event-sequence products for the current earthquake,
                <b>and</b> to delete any event-sequence product that already exists.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The text field tells the servers when an earthquake sequence begins,
            measured in days before the mainshock.
            The default value is 30 days.
            Note: This value is used <b>only</b> for generating the event-sequence product,
            and is used on the event page to display foreshocks.
            It has no effect on aftershock forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            These controls are disabled if the GUI is configured to not support event-sequence.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use Custom Parameters</b></p>
        <p>
            Check this box to send custom aftershock forecast parameters to the servers.
            The servers remember the custom parameters and use them for future forecasts.
            If the box is not checked, then the servers use the default parameters for the region
            in which the current earthquakes is located.
        </p>
        <p>
            The custom parameters include the aftershock search region, magnitude of completeness parameters,
            b-value, fitting insets, forecast magnitude bins, Reasenberg-Jones parameter ranges,
            ETAS enable option, ETAS parameter ranges, ETAS model (Bayesian, sequence-specific, generic),
            and ETAS Bayesian prior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this checkbox does not become active until you fit forecast parameters
            and compute a forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Export Analyst Options</b></p>
        <p>
            Lets you save the analyst options to a JSON file.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you enter the filename.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can later send the saved analyst options to the servers using the
            <b>File Operations</b> panel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Send Analyst Options</b></p>
        <p>
            Lets you send the analyst options to the servers.
            When you click this button, a dialog box opens asking you to confirm that you want to
            send analyst options to the servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI comes pre-configured to communicate with a specific server or pair of servers.
            If the servers require an encrypted connection,
            then you must install <a href="help_digital_cert_files.html">digital certificate files</a>,
            and the GUI may prompt you to enter a PIN.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI can also be pre-configured not to communicate with any server.
            In this case, attempting to send analyst options will produce error messages,
            because the GUI will attempt to contact a non-existent server.
