        <h2>Catalog Windows</h2>
        <p>
            When you load an earthquake catalog into the GUI
            (whether from Comcat, a catalog file, or an existing forecast),
            several windows appear on the right side of the GUI.
            The windows display the catalog in various ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            You access the windows by clicking the tabs located in the top right area of the GUI.
            The windows are described below.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Catalog Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Displays the earthquake catalog as a text file.
            The file is shown in the <a href="help_cat_format_2.html">catalog file format</a>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Epicenters Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Plots the earthquake epicenter locations on a map.
            Aftershocks are plotted in colors that indicate the time at which the aftershock occurred.
            Foreshocks are plotted in gray.
            Each earthquake is shown as an open circle, with larger earthquakes shown as larger circles.
            The aftershock search region is shown as a dashed circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            If regional data is available, then the outer region is shown as a larger dashed circle.
            The display of regional data is useful to assess if the aftershock search region
            is enclosing the earthquake sequence, or if the aftershock search region
            should be adjusted.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Mag/Num Dist Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Shows a magnitude/number plot, with magnitude on the horizonal axis and number on the vertical axis.
            The plot is constructed by grouping aftershocks into magnitude bins 0.1 magnitude wide.
            Then the following are drawn:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Blue circles showing the number of aftershocks in each bin.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                Black circles and lines showing the cumulative number of aftershocks as a function of magnitude.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                A yellow dashed line, with slope equal to the selected Gutenberg-Richter b-value,
                positioned close to the black curve for comparison.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                A green vertical dashed line, labeled &quot;Mmaxc&quot;, at the magnitude of the bin
                that contains the largest number of aftershocks.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                A cyan vertical dashed line, labeled &quot;Mc&quot;, at the estimated magnitude of completeness.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                A red vertical dashed line at the magnitude of the mainshock.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The b-value used to draw the yellow dashed line is the <b>b-value</b> from the <b>Common Parameters</b>
            panel; if you change <b>b-value</b> then the plot will be re-drawn accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The magnitude of completeness used to draw the cyan vertical dashed line is the value of <b>Mc</b> from the <b>Common Parameters</b>
            panel; if you change <b>Mc</b> then the plot will be re-drawn accordingly.
            By default, &quot;Mc&quot; is 0.5 magnitude larger than the &quot;Mmaxc&quot; magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Mag/Time Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Shows a magnitude/time plot, with time on the horizonal axis and magnitude on the vertical axis.
            Each earthquake is shown as a solid circle, colored to indicate distance from the epicenter.
            Earthquakes of larger magnitude are shown as larger circles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The plot includes aftershocks, the mainshock, and foreshocks.
            When the plot is initially displayed, it begin 0.75 days before the mainshock,
            even though the GUI by default fetches foreshocks up to 60 days before the mainshock.
            If you want to see all the foreshocks, use the <b>Set Axis</b> control at the bottom
            of the window to adjust the minimum x-value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Cumulative Num Plot Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Plots the cumulative number of aftershocks as a function of time,
            starting at the time of the mainshock,    
            with time on the horizontal axis and number on the vertical axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, the plot includes aftershocks whose magnitude is above the estimated time-independent
            magnitude of completeness.
            The magnitude of completness used in the plot is the value of <b>Mc</b> from the <b>Common Parameters</b>
            panel; if you change <b>Mc</b> then the plot will be re-drawn accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            When forecasts are computed, the plot changes to include aftershocks whose magnitude is above the
            time-dependent magnitude of competeness Mc(t), and adds cumulative number plots obtained
            from the Reasenberg-Jones forecasts.
            The number of aftershcks is shown in black, while RJ sequence-specific is blue,
            RJ generic is green, and RJ Bayesian is red.
            The time-dependent magnitude of completeness Mc(t) is computed using the parameters
            from the <b>Common Parameters</b> panel.
            The RJ curves show the expected number of aftershocks whose magnitude is above Mc(t),
            as a function of time, as predicted by the RJ model.
            (ETAS number plots are shown on a separate tab.)
