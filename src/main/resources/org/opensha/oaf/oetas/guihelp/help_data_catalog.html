        <h2>Data Source Options: Catalog File</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you specify options for loading an earthquake catalog from a file on disk.
        </p>
        <p>
            The file must be a text file in the <a href="help_cat_format_2.html">catalog file format</a>.
            Alternatively, the file can also be in the <a href="help_cat_legacy_format_2.html">legacy file format</a> that was used
            in earlier versions of the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Catalog Filename<br>Browse Catalog File</b></p>
        <p>
            Use these controls to select a disk file.
            You can type the filename into the text box,
            or you can click the <b>Browse</b> button to open a file chooser dialog.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Call Comcat for mainshock</b></p>
        <p>
            If this box is checked then, in addition to loading the catalog from a file,
            the GUI also calls Comcat to obtain information about the mainshock.
            This information can include such things as aftershock parameters and injectable
            text used in a prior forecast, and information needed to send a forecast to PDL.
            It also lets you handle a situation where the catalog file does not contain a mainshock.
            The following rules apply.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the box is not checked, then there must be a mainshock in the catalog file.
                In this case, all information about the mainshock comes from the catalog file.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If the box is checked, and the <b>USGS Event ID</b> field on the main panel is blank,
                then the catalog file must contain a mainshock entry with a Comcat ID.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If the box is checked, and the <b>USGS Event ID</b> field on the main panel is not blank,
                then the catalog file may, but does need to, contain a mainshock entry.
                The event ID in the <b>USGS Event ID</b> field is used to query Comcat, even if there
                is also a mainshock event ID in the catalog file; this can be useful if event IDs in
                the catalog file are not Comcat IDs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If mainshock information is obtained from Comcat, and there is also a mainshock entry in
            the catalog file, then the GUI uses the mainshock time, magnitude, and location obtained from
            the catalog file (ignoring the time, magnitude, and location obtained from Comcat).
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use analyst options</b></p>
        <p>
            If this box is checked, and <b>Call Comcat for mainshock</b> is also checked,
            then the GUI examines the most recent forecast to see if it contains
            analyst-supplied options for forecast parameters, search region, injectable text, etc.
            If so, then those analyst-supplied options are used to initialize the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the two boxes are not checked, or if no analyst-supplied options are found, then the GUI is
            initialized to default values.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use start and end times<br>Data Start Time<br>Data End Time</b></p>
        <p>
            The GUI needs to know the start and end times of the catalog.
            The time range can be specified either within the catalog file, or by using these controls.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If <b>Use start and end times</b> is checked, then you use the two text fields to enter
                your desired catalog start and end times.
                These fields contain the start and end times of the earthquake catalog,
                expressed as days since the mainshock.
                The start time can be negative, to indicate that the catalog includes
                foreshocks which occur before the mainshock.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>Use start and end times</b> is checked, then the time range you enter takes
                priority over any time range that may be present in the catalog file.
                Also, only earthquakes within the time range you enter are loaded into the GUI
                (except that a mainshock is always loaded regardless of whether it
                is within the time range).<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>Use start and end times</b> is not checked, then the two text fields are read-only.
                In this case, there must be a time range specified within the catalog file.
                When the catalog file is loaded, the text fields are filled in with the start and end
                times that are given in the catalog file.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Set aftershock region<br>Region Radius<br>Region Latitude<br>Region Longitude</b></p>
        <p>
            The GUI needs to know the aftershock search region.
            The region can be specified either within the catalog file, or by using these controls.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If <b>Set aftershock region</b> is checked, then you use the three text fields to enter
                a circular aftershock search region.
                Enter the radius of the circle in kilometers,
                and enter the latitude and longitude of the circle center in decimal degrees.
                The latitude can range from -90.0 to 90.0, with positive values denoting the northern hemisphere.
                The longitude can range from -180.0 to 180.0, with positive values denoting the eastern hemisphere.
                The maximum allowed radius is 20,000 km, which is slightly less than 180 degrees of arc.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>Set aftershock region</b> is checked, then the region you enter takes
                priority over any search region that may be present in the catalog file.
                Also, only earthquakes within the search region you enter are loaded into the GUI
                (except that a mainshock is always loaded regardless of whether it
                is within the region).<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>Set aftershock region</b> is not checked, then the three text fields are disabled.
                In this case, there must be an aftershock search region specified within the catalog file.
            </li>
        </ul>
