        <h2>Data Source Options: Comcat</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you specify options for loading an earthquake catalog from Comcat.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use start and end times</b></p>
        <p>
            By default, the GUI fetches earthquakes beginning 60 days before the mainshock,
            and ending 10 minutes before the current time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to override this behavior, then you can check this box, and enter your desired
            catalog start and end times in the fields below.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Data Start Time<br>Data End Time</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields contain the start and end times of the earthquake catalog,
            expressed as days since the mainshock.
            The start time can be negative, to indicate that the catalog includes
            foreshocks which occur before the mainshock.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If <b>Use start and end times</b> is checked, then you use these fields to enter
                your desired catalog start and end time.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>Use start and end times</b> is not checked, then these fields are read-only.
                When the catalog is loaded, these fields are filled in with the start and end
                times that were actually used to fetch the catalog from Comcat.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use minimum magnitude<br>Minimum magnitude</b></p>
        <p>
            These control the minimum magnitude earthquakes to be fetched from Comcat.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If <b>Use minimum magnitude</b> is checked, then you can enter the minimum magnitude
                in the <b>Minimum Magnitude</b> field.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                If <b>Use minimum magnitude</b> is not checked, then the system selects a minimum
                magnitude. It is typically 0.5 magnitude less than the pre-programmed magnitude of
                completeness for the mainshock&#39;s location.
                In this case the <b>Minimum Magnitude</b> field is disabled.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that if you are accessing a very large earthquake sequence, then you may want to
            increase the minimum magnitude so as to reduce the number of earthquakes that are loaded
            into the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Use analyst options</b></p>
        <p>
            If this box is checked, then the GUI examines the most recent forecast to see if it contains
            analyst-supplied options for forecast parameters, search region, injectable text, etc.
            If so, then those analyst-supplied options are used to initialize the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this box is not checked, or if no analyst-supplied options are found, then the GUI is
            initialized to default values.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Region Type</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down list selects what type of aftershock search region you want to use.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Standard</i> - Lets the system select the search region.
                If <b>Use analyst options</b> is checked and the most recent forecast contains an
                analyst-selected search region, then that search region is used.
                Otherwise, the pre-programmed search region is used.
                The pre-programmed search region is a circle, whose radius equals the Wells and Coppersmith
                rupture length, and whose center is determined by the centroid algorithm.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Centroid WC Circle</i> - The search region is a circle, whose radius is a multiple of the
                Wells and Coppersmith rupture length, and whose center is determined by the centroid algorithm.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Centroid Circle</i> - The search region is a circle, whose radius is a specified number
                of kilometers, and whose center is determined by the centroid algorithm.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Epicenter WC Circle</i> - The search region is a circle, whose radius is a multiple of the
                Wells and Coppersmith rupture length, and whose center is the mainshock&#39;s epicenter.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Epicenter Circle</i> - The search region is a circle, whose radius is a specified number
                of kilometers, and whose center is the mainshock&#39;s epicenter.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Custom Circle</i> - The search region is a circle. You can enter the circle&#39;s radius in kilometers,
                and the latitude and longitude of the circle&#39;s center<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Custom Rectangle</i> - The search region is a rectangle. You can enter the minimum and maximum
                values for latitude and longitude. Note that although rectangular search regions are supported,
                they have never been used.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Region</b></p>
        <p>
            This button opens a sub-panel that you use to edit the aftershock search region.
            The contents of the sub-panel varies depending on the region type.
            The button is disabled if the region type is <i>Standard</i>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Show outer region</b></p>
        <p>
            If this box is checked, then the GUI fetches earthquakes in a region that is approximately
            70 percent larger than the aftershock search region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Earthquakes outside the aftershock search region do not participate in parameter fitting,
            but they are included in the catalog and are plotted in the <b>Epicenters Tab</b>.
            Also, the outer region itself is plotted as a large dashed circle that is concentric with the
            aftershock search region. You can examine the plot to see if the chosen aftershock
            search region is capturing the sequence.
