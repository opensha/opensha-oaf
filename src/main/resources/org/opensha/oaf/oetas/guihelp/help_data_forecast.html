        <h2>Data Source Options: Published Forecast</h2>
        <p>
            This panel can display a list of all published forecasts for the mainshock,
            and select one to load into the GUI.
            Only forecasts that include a download file (forecast_data.json) are considered.
            The mainshock event ID is specified using the <b>USGS Event ID</b> field on the main panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI loads the earthquake catalog that is contained within the download file.
            Also, forecast parameters in the GUI are initialized to the parameter values in the download file
            that were used to create the published forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Populate Forecast List</b></p>
        <p>
            Click this button to query Comcat and obtain a list of published forecasts
            that include a download file.
            The list is loaded into the <b>Available Forecasts</b> drop-down so that
            you can make a selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you don&#39;t have to click the button if you just want to use the
            most recent forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Include superseded</b></p>
        <p>
            Check the box if you want to retrieve a list of all forecasts for the mainshock.
        </p>
        <p>
            Uncheck the box if you only want to retrieve the most recent forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Available Forecasts</b></p>
        <p>
            If you clicked the <b>Populate</b> button, this drop-down lists all the published forecasts
            that have a download file.
            Each forecast is identified by the date and time it was issued.
            Forecasts are listed in reverse chronologial order.
            You should select the desired forecast from the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you did not click the <b>Populate</b> button, this drop-down displays <i>Use current forecast</i>,
            which tells the GUI to load the most recent forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Data Start Time<br>Data End Time</b></p>
        <p>
            These are read-only fields.
            When a published forecast is loaded, these fields are set to the start and end times of the
            earthquake catalog, expressed as days since the mainshock.
            The start time can be negative, to indicate that the catalog includes
            foreshocks which occur before the mainshock.
