        <h2>Aftershock Parameters Panel</h2>
        <p>
            Use the aftershock parameters panel to adjust the parameters that are used
            to compute forecasts.
            After setting parameters, you can fit the model parameters and compute forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>RJ Parameers</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you select parameters for Reasenberg-Jones forecasts.
            These include parameter ranges for the RJ search grid.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Common Parameers</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you select parameters that are common to both RJ and ETAS.
            These let you adjust the magnitude of completeness, b-value, fitting interval,
            and forecast magnitude ranges.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS Forecasts</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down list controls the use of ETAS. It offers the following choices.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Auto</i> - Lets the system decide whether or not to compute an ETAS forecast.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Enable</i> - Forces the system to compute an ETAS forecast.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Disable</i> - Tells the system not to compute an ETAS forecast.
                Only RJ forecasts will be computed.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Enable (Fit Only)</i> - Tells the system to perform ETAS parameter fitting,
                but not compute an ETAS forecast.
                ETAS forecasts can take some time to compute because they require running a large
                number of simulations. So, you may want to select this option if you are only
                interested in viewing the distribution of ETAS parameters.
                Note that this option cannot be sent to the OAF server.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The system always computes RJ forecasts, regardless of whether or not it is
            also computing an ETAS forecast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The drop-down is disabled if the GUI is configured to not support ETAS.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS Parameers</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you select parameters for ETAS forecasts.
            These include parameter ranges for the ETAS search grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            The button is disabled if the GUI is configured to not support ETAS.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS Options</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you select various options for ETAS forecasts.
            These include the ETAS model (Bayesian, sequence-specific, generic),
            the Bayesian prior, and the values of b and alpha.
        </p>
        <p>
            The button is disabled if the GUI is configured to not support ETAS.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Aftershock Params and Forecast</b></p>
        <p>
            When you click this button, the GUI performs parameter fitting and then
            computes forecasts.
            The results are displayed in the right-hand side of the GUI
            in several tabs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Cumulative Num Plot Tab</b> - Plots the cumulative number of aftershocks as a function of time.
                If a time-dependent magnitude of completeness is being used, then the plot only includes
                aftershocks that are above the time-dependent magnitude of completeness.
                In addition, the plot shoes the expected cumulative number of aftershocks as a function of time
                according the Reasenberg-Jones forecasts.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Model PDFs Tab</b> - Plots the marginal distributions of the model parameters.
                The plots are displayed in a series of sub-tabs.
                There are separate sub-tabs for RJ and ETAS marginal distributions.<br>&nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For each model parameter that is not fixed, there is a plot of its
                        univariate or 1D marginal distribution.
                        The plot has the parameter value on the horizonal axis,
                        and the probability density on the vertical axis.
                        A single plot can include marginals for the generic, sequence-specific,
                        and/or Bayesian models.
                        The ETAS parameters n (branch ratio), c (Omori offset), and mu (background rate)
                        are plotted on a log scale; all others are plotted on a linear scale.<br>&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For each pair of model parameters that are not fixed, there is a plot of their
                        bivariate or 2D marginal distribution.
                        The plot has one parameter value on the horizonal axis and the other
                        parameter value on the vertical axis.
                        Color is used to show the probability density.
                        Only the sequence-specific model is shown in the 2D marginal plots.
                        (If a parameter is plotted on a log scale, then the axis is labeled with the
                        base-10 logarithm of the parameter value instead of the parameter value itself,
                        due to a limitation in the OpenSHA plotting library.)<br>&nbsp;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>ETAS Number Plots Tab</b> - Contains plots that compare the integral of the
                ETAS intensity function with the observed cumulative number of aftershocks.
                Ideally, they should be similar.
                The plots are computed using the maximum likelihood estimates of the ETAS parameters.
                The plots are displayed in a series of sub-tabs.
                There are two types of plots.<br>&nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are two plots that show both the integral of the ETAS intensity
                        function and the observed cumulative number of aftershock on the same
                        graph, as functions of time.
                        Each plot has time on the horizontal axis,
                        and integrated intensity or cumulative number on the vertical axis.
                        Of the two plots, one shows only the sequence-specific model,
                        and the other shows generic, sequence-specific, and Bayesian models.<br>&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are two plots that show the observed cumulative number of aftershocks
                        as a function of transformed time.
                        Each plot has transformed time on the horizontal axis,
                        and cumulative number on the vertical axis.
                        Transformed time is equal to the integral of the ETAS intensity function.
                        In other words, the ETAS model expects one aftershock per unit of transformed time.
                        If there was perfect agreement, the observed cumulative number of aftershocks
                        would plot as a straight line with a slope of one.
                        Of the two plots, one shows only the sequence-specific model,
                        and the other shows generic, sequence-specific, and Bayesian models.<br>&nbsp;
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Forecast Table Tab</b> - Contains the forecast table.
                The table shows the expected number of aftershocks and the probability of one or more
                aftershock, for various magnitude ranges, occurring in the next day, week, month, and year.
                There are also has controls you can use to adjust the advisory duration, set the time
                of the next forecast, save the forecast to a file, or send the forecast to PDL.
            </li>
