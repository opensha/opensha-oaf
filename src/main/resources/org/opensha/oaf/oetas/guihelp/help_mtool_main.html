        <h2>More Tools Panel</h2>
        <p>
            This panel provides a variety of tools, most of which let you interact with
            the AAFS servers, PDL, and Comcat.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Analyst Parameers</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you adjust OAF server parameters.
            You can use this sub-panel to perform the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Turn forecasts on or off.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select how long the server should produce forecasts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter injectable text or an analyst remark.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select whether the server generates event-sequence products.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select whether the server should use custom aftershock parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send analyst options to the server.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save analyst options to a file.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Save Aftershock Catalog</b></p>
        <p>
            Lets you save the aftershock catalog to a file.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you enter the filename.
            The catalog is saved in the <a href="help_cat_format_2.html">catalog file format</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This button becomes active when you load data into the GUI that includes a catalog.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>AAFS Server Status</b></p>
        <p>
            Contacts the AAFS servers and displays their current status.
            For each server, the status is either <i>Alive</i> or <i>Dead</i>.
            Additional status information is displaeyed in the <b>Console tab</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI comes pre-configured to communicate with a specific server or pair of servers.
            If the servers require an encrypted connection, then you must install digital certificate
            files in the same directory as the GUI JAR file, and the GUI may prompt you to enter a PIN.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI can also be pre-configured not to communicate with any server.
            In this case, clicking the button will produce error messages,
            because the GUI will attempt to contact a non-existent server.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Delete Product</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you delete an OAF product from Comcat,
            and optionally also modify or delete an associated event-sequence product.
            The delete is sent directly to PDL.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>File Operations</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you perform the following operations on files:
         </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Send a saved forecast_data.json file directly to PDL (which may also send an event-sequence product).
            </li>
            <li>
                Send a saved forecast.json file directly to PDL, and optionally also an event-sequence product.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send a saved analyst options file to the AAFS servers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Event Picker</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you search for earthquakes and pick an earthquake to work with.
            Searches can be constrained by magnitude and by geographic region.
