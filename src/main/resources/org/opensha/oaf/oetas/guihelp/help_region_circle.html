        <h2>Edit Region: Custom Circle</h2>
        <p>
            This region is a circle whose radius is a specified number of kilometers.
            The center of the circle is located at a specified latitude and longitude.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Radius</b></p>
        <p>
            The region&#39;s radius, in kilometers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maximum allowed radius is 20,000 km, which is slightly less than 180 degrees of arc.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Center Latitude<br>Center Longitude</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields contain the latitude and longitude of the region&#39;s center, in decimal degrees.
        </p>
        <p>
            The latitude can range from -90.0 to 90.0, with positive values denoting the northern hemisphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            The longitude can range from -180.0 to 180.0, with positive values denoting the eastern hemisphere.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Min Depth<br>Max Depth</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields contain the minimum and maximum allowed depth of aftershocks and foreshocks, in kilometers.
            Any aftershocks or foreshocks whose depth lies outside this range are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default values are -5.0 and 700.0, which is the largest depth range allowed by OpenSHA.
            It is strongly recommended that you not change these value.
