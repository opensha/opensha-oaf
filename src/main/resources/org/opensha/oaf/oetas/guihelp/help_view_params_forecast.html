        <h2>Parameter and Forecast Windows</h2>
        <p>
            When you fit aftershock parameters,
            several windows appear on the right side of the GUI.
            The windows display the parameters in various ways.
            If you also compute forecasts, then an additionall window appears to display the forecast.
        </p>
        <p>
            You access the windows by clicking the tabs located in the top right area of the GUI.
            The windows are described below.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Cumulative Num Plot Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Plots the cumulative number of aftershocks as a function of time.
            If a time-dependent magnitude of completeness is being used, then the plot only includes
            aftershocks that are above the time-dependent magnitude of completeness Mc(t).
            The plot also shows the expected number of aftershocks whose magnitude is above Mc(t),
            as a function of time, as predicted by the RJ model.
            The number of aftershcks is shown in black, while RJ sequence-specific is blue,
            RJ generic is green, and RJ Bayesian is red.
            The time-dependent magnitude of completeness Mc(t) is computed using the parameters
            from the <b>Common Parameters</b> panel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Model PDFs Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            Plots the marginal distributions of the model parameters.
            The plots are displayed in a series of sub-tabs.
            There are separate sub-tabs for RJ and ETAS marginal distributions.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each model parameter that is not fixed, there is a plot of its
            univariate or 1D marginal distribution.
            The plot has the parameter value on the horizonal axis,
            and the probability density on the vertical axis.
            A single plot can include marginals for the generic, sequence-specific,
            and/or Bayesian models.
            The sequence-specific marginal is plotted as a blue histogram,
            the generic as a green curve, and the Bayesian as a red curve.
            The ETAS parameters n (branch ratio), c (Omori offset), and mu (background rate)
            are plotted on a log scale; all others are plotted on a linear scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each pair of model parameters that are not fixed, there is a plot of their
            bivariate or 2D marginal distribution.
            The plot has one parameter value on the horizonal axis and the other
            parameter value on the vertical axis.
            Color is used to show the probability density.
            Only the sequence-specific model is shown in the 2D marginal plots.
            (If a parameter is plotted on a log scale, then the axis is labeled with the
            base-10 logarithm of the parameter value instead of the parameter value itself,
            due to a limitation in the OpenSHA plotting library.)<br>&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>ETAS Number Plots Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            This window is only shown if ETAS is enabled.
            It contains plots that compare the integral of the
            ETAS intensity function with the observed cumulative number of aftershocks.
            Ideally, they should be similar.
            The plots are computed using the maximum likelihood estimates of the ETAS parameters.
            The plots are displayed in a series of sub-tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two plots that show both the integral of the ETAS intensity
            function and the observed cumulative number of aftershocks on the same
            graph, as functions of time.
            Each plot has time on the horizontal axis,
            and integrated intensity or cumulative number on the vertical axis.
            Of the two plots, one shows only the sequence-specific model,
            and the other shows generic, sequence-specific, and Bayesian models.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, there are two plots that show the observed cumulative number of aftershocks
            as a function of transformed time.
            Each plot has transformed time on the horizontal axis,
            and cumulative number on the vertical axis.
            Transformed time is equal to the integral of the ETAS intensity function.
            In other words, the ETAS model expects one aftershock per unit of transformed time.
            If there was perfect agreement, the observed cumulative number of aftershocks
            would plot as a straight line with a slope of one.
            Of the two plots, one shows only the sequence-specific model,
            and the other shows generic, sequence-specific, and Bayesian models.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Forecast Table Tab</b></p>
        <p>
            If you computed forecasts, then this window ontains the forecast tables.
            There can be up to four forecasts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ETAS.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasenberg-Jones sequence-specific.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasenberg-Jones generic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasenberg-Jones Bayesian.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You use the tabs at the top of the window to select which forecast you want to view.
            Each table shows the expected number of aftershocks (95% confidence interval and median), and the probability of one or more
            aftershock, for various magnitude ranges, occurring in the next day, week, month, and year.
            There are also controls you can use to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Save the forecast to a file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send the forecast to PDL.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the advisory duration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select the OAF product template.
            </li>
            <li>
                Specify the time at which the next forecast will be issued.
            </li>
        </ul>
