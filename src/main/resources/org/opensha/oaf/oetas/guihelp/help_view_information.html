        <h2>Information Window</h2>
        <p>

            and is accessed by clicking the <b>Information tab</b>.
            The information window is always available.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information window shows the current status of the GUI.

        </p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The contents of the information window changes as you work with the GUI.
            New information replaces the previous contents of the information window,
            so the contents is always current.
