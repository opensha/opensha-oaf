        <h2>File Operations</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you transmit saved analyst options and saved forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The panel becomes active when you load data into the GUI.
            (If you load data from a catalog file then you need to check the <b>Call Comcat for mainshock</b>
            chackbox in order for this panel to be active.)
            The functions in this panel do not require that you fit parameters or compute a forecast;
            all that is needed is a mainshock.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Send Analyst Options File</b></p>
        <p>
            If you previously saved analyst options into a JSON file,
            then you can use this button to send the saved options to the servers.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you select the,
            and then a dialog box opens asking you to confirm that you want to
            send analyst options to the servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI comes pre-configured to communicate with a specific server or pair of servers.
            If the servers require an encrypted connection,
            then you must install <a href="help_digital_cert_files.html">digital certificate files</a>,
            and the GUI may prompt you to enter a PIN.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI can also be pre-configured not to communicate with any server.
            In this case, attempting to send analyst options will produce error messages,
            because the GUI will attempt to contact a non-existent server.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Send Forecast File</b></p>
        <p>
            If you previously saved a forecast in the form of a forecast_data.json file,
            then you can use this button to send the saved forecast directly to PDL.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you select the,
            and then a dialog box opens asking you to confirm that you want to
            send the forecast to PDL.
        </p>
        <p>
            The forecast_data.json file should contain a forecast for the earthquake that is
            currenlty loaded in the GUI.
            The GUI warns you if this is not true.
        </p>
        <p>
            The forecast_data.json file contains information on whether or not to also send
            an event-sequence product.
            When you click this button, the event-sequence product is also sent,
            if so indicated in the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the PDL destination is <i>Dry Run</i>, which means that the GUI goes through the motions
            of sending the OAF and event-sequence products but does not send anything to PDL.
            In order to send products to PDL, you must use the GUI command line to specify the
            PDL destination and private key file.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Event Sequence Option<br>Event Sequence Lookback<br>Send forecast.json</b></p>
        <p>
            If you previously saved a forecast in the form of a forecast.json file,
            then you can use the button to send the saved forecast directly to PDL.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you select the,
            and then a dialog box opens asking you to confirm that you want to
            send the forecast to PDL.
        </p>
        <p>
            The forecast.json file should contain a forecast for the earthquake that is
            currenlty loaded in the GUI.
            The GUI has no way to check if this is true, so be certain to check it yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you click the button, the GUI can also send an event-sequence product,
            in addition to sending an OAF product.
            The forecast.json file contains no information about the event-sequence product.
            So, you can use the drop-down list to select whether or not to also send an event-sequence product:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Auto</i> - Use the standard algorithm to decide whether or not to send an event-sequence product.
                By default, the event-sequence product will be sent.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Update</i> - Send an event-sequence product for the current earthquake.
                Currently, this is essentially the same thing as using the standard algorithm.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Ignore</i> - Do <b>not</b> generate, modify, or delete an event-sequence product
                for the current earthquake.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Delete</i> - Delete any event-sequence product that already exists.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The text field specifies when an earthquake sequence begins,
            measured in days before the mainshock.
            The default value is 30 days.
            Note: This value is used <b>only</b> for generating the event-sequence product,
            and is used on the event page to display foreshocks.
            It has no effect on aftershock forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The event-sequence controls are disabled if the GUI is configured to not support event-sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the PDL destination is <i>Dry Run</i>, which means that the GUI goes through the motions
            of sending the OAF and event-sequence products but does not send anything to PDL.
            In order to send products to PDL, you must use the GUI command line to specify the
            PDL destination and private key file.
