        <h2>Data Source Panel</h2>
        <p>
            Use the data source panel to load data into the GUI.
            Data can come from Comcat, from a catalog file, or from a forecast download file.
            The data consists of a mainshock and its associated foreshocks and aftershocks.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>USGS Event ID</b></p>
        <p>
            Enter a Comcat event ID if you are loading data from Comcat.
            Otherwise, you can leave it blank.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Data Source Type</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down list selects what type of data you want to load.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Comcat</i> - Loads a mainshock from Comcat, calculates the aftershock search region,
                and then fetches the foreshocks and aftershocks.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Catalog File</i> - Reads in a file that contains information about the mainshock,
                foreshocks, and aftershocks. The file can also contain an aftershock search region
                and other information.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Published Forecast</i> - Loads a mainshock from Comcat, and then retrieves the earthquake
                catalog and forecast parameters from one of the existing aftershock forecasts.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Mainshock Only</i> - Loads only a mainshock from Comcat, without loading an earthquake catalog.
                This can be used for operations that don&#39;t require a catalog, such as turning forecasts on or off,
                setting injectable text, setting forecast duration, and selecting event-sequence options.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Download File</i> - Reads a forecast_data.json file, and obtains the mainshock,
                earthquake catalog, and forecast parameters from the file.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Data Source</b></p>
        <p>
            Opens a sub-panel that lets you select various options for loading data.
            The set of options varies depending on the data source type.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Catalog</b></p>
        <p>
            This button loads the data.
            The data includes a mainshock,
            and for all data types except <i>Mainshock Only</i> it also includes an earthquake catalog.
            The earthquake catalog is displayed in the right-hand side of the GUI
            in several tabs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Catalog Tab</b> - Displays the earthquake catalog as a text file.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Epicenters Tab</b> - Plots the earthquake epicenter locations on a map.
                Colors indicate the time at which an earhquake occurred.
                The aftershock search region is shown as a dashed circle.
                If regional data is available, then the outer region is shown as a larger dashed circle.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mag/Num Dist Tab</b> - Groups aftershocks into magnitude bins 0.1 magnitude wide, and shows a
                plot with magnitude on the horizontal axis and number on the vertical axis (a magnitude/number plot).
                Also shows cumulative number of aftershocks, magnitude of completeness, and the Gutenberg-Richter relation.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mag/Time Tab</b> - Plots earthquakes with time on the horizontal axis and magnitude on the
                vertical axis (a magnitude/time plot).
                Colors indicate distance from the epicenter.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cumulative Num Plot Tab</b> - Plots the cumulative number of aftershocks as a function of time,
                with time on the horizontal axis and number on the vertical axis.
                Initially, the plot includes aftershocks whose magnitude is above the estimated time-independent
                magnitude of completeness.
                When forecasts are computed, the plot changes to include aftershocks whose magnitude is above the
                time-dependent magnitude of competeness, and adds cumulative number plots obtained
                from the Reasenberg-Jones forecasts.
                (ETAS number plots are shown on a separate tab.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Depending on the selected options, the aftershock forecast parameters can be initialized to their default values,
            or they can be initialized to values obtained from an existing forecast or download file.
