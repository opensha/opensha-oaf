        <h2>Command Line: Sending a Forecast to PDL</h2>
        <p>
            If you have a file that contains a saved forecast (in forecast_data.json format),
            you can use these command line options to send the forecast to PDL.
            The forecast will appear on the event page just like a forecast produced by the OAF servers,
            with both forecast.json and forecast_data.json files available for download.
        </p>
        <p>
            An event-sequence product will be sent if the event-sequence options contained within the
            forecast_data.json file indicate that an event-sequence product should be sent,
            and if the GUI is configured to support event-sequence.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Example</b></p>
        <p>
            For example, the following command line can be used to send a foreast
            to the PDL production system.
            If the GUI is configured to support event-sequence, then the command line
            may also send an event-sequence product.
        </p>
<pre>
java -jar AftershockGUI-2026_01_06.jar --pdl=prod --privateKey=mykeyfile --send=my_forecast_data.json
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, the <code>--pdl</code> option specifies that products should be sent to the production PDL system,
            and the <code>--privateKey</code> option specifies the digital key file that is used to sign products.
            The <code>--send</code> option specifies that we want to send a forecast,
            and gives the name of the file that contains the forecast.json.
            Note that the name of the GUI jar file may be different than shown.
            Also, note that you don&#39;t need to specify the mainshock event ID, because it is
            contained within the forecast_data.json file.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <p>
            When sending a forecast, the following option is required:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--send=JSONFILENAME</code><br>
            The following option is optional; if omitted, then the GUI supplies a default value:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--reviewed=ISREVIEWED</code><br>
            The following options are obsolete; you should avoid using them:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--code=PRODUCTCODE</code><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--eventsource=EVENTNETWORK</code><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--eventsourcecode=EVENTCODE</code><br>
            The options are described in detail below.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the options described on this page, you can also use the
            <a href="help_cmdline_pdl.html">PDL configuration options</a>
            and the <a href="help_cmdline_gui_config.html">GUI confguration options</a>.
            The most often used PDL configuration options are:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--pdl=PDLDESTINATION</code><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--privateKey=PRIVATEKEYFILE</code><br>
            The most often used GUI configuration option enables or disables support for event-sequence:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>--evseq-config=EVSEQCONFIG</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Options may appear in the command line in any order.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you use the command line to send a forecast, the graphical user interface does not start.
            After the forecast is sent, the GUI exits and returns control to the operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that, as an alternative to using the command line,
            you can also send a saved forecast to PDL from within the graphical user interface
            by opening the <b>File Operations</b> control panel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Option Details</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--send=JSONFILENAME
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--send</code> option specifies that you want to send a forecast to PDL,
            and also gives the name of the file that contains the forecast in forecast_data.json format.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--reviewed=true
--reviewed=false
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--reviewed</code> option specifies whether the forecast is marked as being reviewed by an analyst.
            The review status is shown on the event page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the <code>--reviewed</code> option is omitted, the GUI supplies a default value of <i>true</i>.
