        <h2>Digital Certificate Files</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to communicate with the AAFS servers,
            and the servers require an encrypted connection, then you must install two digital certificate files.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two files are called <b>oafcert_app.p12</b> and <b>oafcert_cacert</b>.
            You need to install them by copying them into the same directory where the GUI jar file is located.
        </p>
        <p>
            You also need to know the PIN that is associated with the digital certificates.
            When you communicate with the servers, the GUI prompts you to enter the PIN.
            The GUI remembers the PIN, so you do not have to enter the PIN again so long as you keep the GUI open.
