        <h2>Edit RJ Parameters</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you set the parameter ranges for the Reasenberg-Jones search grid.
            The total number of points in the search grid is limited to a maximum of 200,000.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>RJ a-value Range<br>RJ a-value Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;a&quot; parameter,
            which is the productivity.
            The productivity has a linear scale, so the grid points are equally spaced.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>RJ p-value Range<br>RJ p-value Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;p&quot; parameter,
            which is the Omori exponent.
            The Omori exponent has a linear scale, so the grid points are equally spaced.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the RJ code cannot compute a Bayesian forecast if the Omori
            exponent is allowed to vary.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>RJ c-value Range<br>RJ c-value Number</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields control the range for the &quot;c&quot; parameter,
            which is the Omori offset.
            The Omori offset has a linear scale, so the grid points are equally spaced.
            You can enter the minimum and maximum values of the parameter,
            and the number of grid points for the parameter.
            If you want to fix the parameter at a single value,
            enter 1 for the number and set the minimum and maximum to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the RJ code cannot compute a Bayesian forecast if the Omori
            offset is allowed to vary.
            Also note that the Omori offset should probably have a log scale, but
            for historical reasons it doesn&#39;t.
