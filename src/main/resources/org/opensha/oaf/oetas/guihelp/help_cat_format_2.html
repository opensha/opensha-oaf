        <h2>Catalog File Format</h2>
        <p>
            A catalog file contains a list of earthquakes.
            For each earthquake, the file contains its date and time, latitude, longitude, depth,
            magnitude, and, optionally, an ID.
            Each earthquake is categorized as a mainshock, foreshock, aftershock, or regional.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, a catalog file can contain a list of symbol definitions.
            Symbols can be used to speify the catalog&#39;s time range, minimum magnitude,
            depth range, aftershock search region, and outer search region.
        </p>
        <p>
            We first show an example of a catalog file, and then describe the format in detail.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>General Layout</b></p>
        <p>
            Each line in the file is either an earthquake line or a comment line.
            A line that starts with # is a comment line.
            A completely blank line is also considered to be a comment line.
            All other lines are earthquake lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Items appearing within a line can be separated by any number of spaces and/or tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each earthquake line contains information for one earthquake:
            date and time, latitude, longitude, depth, magnitude, and, optionally, an ID.
            Earthquake lines are grouped into sections. Each section contains one type
            of earthquake: mainshock, foreshock, aftershock, or regional.
            This is described further below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some comment lines have special significance to the GUI.
            A line that starts with &quot;#begin:&quot; is a section header.
            A line that starts with &quot;#define:&quot; is a symbol definition.
            These are described further below.
            All other comment lines are ignored when the catalog file is loaded into the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the GUI writes a catalog file, it adds several comment lines beginning with
            &quot;#count:&quot; which show the total number of earthquakes in the file,
            as well as the number of earthquakes in each section. These lines are purely for
            documentation, and are ignored when the file is loaded into the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Earthquake Lines</b></p>
        <p>
            Each earthquake line describes one earthquake, and contains the following items:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Date and time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Latitude, in decimal degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Longitude, in decimal degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Depth, in kilometers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Magnitude.
            </li>
            <li>
                Event ID. This is optional. If included, it can be any string consisting of uppercase letters,
                lowercase letters, digits, and the underscore character.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The date and time consists of the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, in that order.
            The year must be given as four digits; the others can be given as one or two digits.
            All times are UTC.
            When loading a catalog file, the GUI accepts several formats.
            Here are some examples.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard format: 2025-04-14 17:08:28</li>
            <li>Leading zero suppression: 2025-4-14 17:8:28</li>
            <li>ISO-8601 format: 2025-04-14T17:08:28Z</li>
            <li>Space or tab delimited: 2025 04 14 17 08 28</li>
            <li>Slash delimited zero suppressed date: 2025/4/14 17:08:28</li>
            <li>UTC suffix: 2025-04-14 17:08:28 UTC</li>
            <li>Dot delimited date and time: 2025.04.14 17.08.28</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Section Headers</b></p>
        <p>
            A section header is a comment line that consists of &quot;#begin:&quot; followed by the
            name of the section.
            Earthquake lines that appear after the section header belong to that section.
            The earthquakes within a section can be listed in any order.
        </p>
        <p>
            The allowed section names and their meaning are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The &quot;mainshock&quot; section contains one earthquake, which is the mainshock.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The &quot;aftershock&quot; section contains any number of earthquakes,
                which are inside the aftershock search region and occurred after the mainshock.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The &quot;foreshock&quot; section contains any number of earthquakes,
                which are inside the aftershock search region and occurred before the mainshock.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The &quot;regional&quot; section contains any number of earthquakes,
                which are outside the aftershock search region.
                They may have occurred before or after the mainshock.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sections may appear in any order, and all sections are optional.
            However, if there is no &quot;mainshock&quot; section then you will have to manually enter
            a mainshock event ID when loading the catalog file into the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Symbol Definitions</b></p>
        <p>
            A symbol definition is a comment line that consists of &quot;#define:&quot; followed by the
            name of the symbol, followed by an equal sign, followed by the value of the symbol.
            The value can consist of several data elements, which are typically numbers or strings.
            Data elements can be separated by any number of spaces and/or tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some symbols have special meaning to the GUI. They are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The value of the &quot;time_range&quot; symbol is two numbers that give the start time
                and end time of the catalog.
                Times are expressed as days since the mainshock.
                A negative number indicates a time before the mainshock.
                (These are the start and end times used, e.g., for querying Comcat.
                They are not the times of the earliest and latest earthquakes in the catalog.)<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The value of the &quot;min_mag&quot; symbol is a number that gives the
                minimum magnitude of the catalog.
                (This is the minimum magnitude used, e.g., for querying Comcat.
                It is not the minimum magnitude of any earthquake in the catalog.)<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The value of the &quot;depth_range&quot; symbol is two numbers that give the minimum
                and maximum depths of the catalog, expressed in kilometers.
                (These are the minimum and maximum depths used, e.g., for querying Comcat.
                They are not the minimum and maximum depth among earthquakes appearing in the catalog.)<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The &quot;aftershock_region&quot; symbol gives the aftershock search region.
                If the region is a circle, then the value is the string &quot;circle&quot; followed
                by three numbers that give the latitude of the center, the longitude of the center,
                and the radius in kilometers.
                If the region is a rectangle, then the value is the string &quot;rectangle&quot; followed
                by four numbers that give the minimum latitude, the maximum latitude, the minimum longitude,
                and the maximum longitude; if the ractangle crosses the date line then the maximum
                longitude will be greater than 180 degrees.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                The &quot;outer_region&quot; symbol gives the search region used to obtain regional earthquakes.
                The region is represented in the same way as the &quot;aftershock_region&quot; symbol.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All symbol definitions are optional. It is recommended that the catalog file include at
            least the &quot;time_range&quot; and &quot;aftershock_region&quot; symbols, because if those symbols
            are missing then you have to enter that information into the GUI manually when loading
            the catalog file.
        </p>
        <p>
            When loading a catalog file, the GUI ignores any symbol definitions with names that the
            GUI does not recognize. So, it is possible for you to define your own symbols, which the
            GUI will ignore.
