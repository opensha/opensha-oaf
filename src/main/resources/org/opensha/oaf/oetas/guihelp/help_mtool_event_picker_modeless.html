        <h2>Event Picker</h2>
        <p>
            You can use the event picker to search for earthquakes in Comcat.
            Once you find an earthquake, you can select it for use in the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Available Earthquakes</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down shows the results of a search.
            Earthquakes are listed in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
            Each entry shows the date, magnitude, and description of an earthquake.
            The drop-down is filled in when you click the <b>Populate</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>
            You select the earthquake you want to work with from this drop-down.
            When you click on an earthquake, it becomes selected and
            its event ID appears in the <b>Select</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Minimum Magnitude</b></p>
        <p>
            Use this drop-down to select the type of search that you want to perform.
            You can search for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any earthquake that has an OAF product.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                An earthquake that has an OAF product and is at least a selected
                minimum magnitude.
                For example, you can search for earthquake of magnitude 6.0 and
                larger with an OAF product.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                A recent earthquake of at least a selected magnitude, regardless
                of whether or not it has an OAF product.
                For example, you can search for magnitude 5.0 and larger earthquakes
                within the past month.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Search Region</b></p>
        <p>
            Use this drop-down to select a geographic region to search.
            If you select <i>World</i> then the search looks for earthquakes
            anywhere in the world.
            If you nake a different selection then the search is limited to
            earthquakes in the selected region.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the GUI usually looks in a somewhat larger area than the
            selected region.
            For example, if you select <i>California</i> then the GUI searches in
            the area covered by the California seismic networks (SCSN and NCSS),
            which extends somewhat beyond the borders of California.
        </p>

        <p><b>Populate Event List</b></p>
        <p>
            Press the button to contact Comcat and perform the search.
            The results of the search are inserted into the <b>Available Earthquakes</b>
            drop-down list.
        </p>
        <p>
            A dialog box is displayed if no earthquakes are found that satisfy the
            conditions of the search.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Select</b></p>
        <p>
            When an earthquake in the <b>Available Earthquakes</b> drop-down is selected,
            this button becomes active, and the event ID is inserted into the button.
            Press the button to transfer the event ID
            into the <b>USGS Event ID</b> field in the main panel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Cancel</b></p>
        <p>
            Press this button to close the event picker without choosing an earthquake.
