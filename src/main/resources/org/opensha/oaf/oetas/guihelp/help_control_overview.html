        <h2>Overview of Control Panels</h2>
        <p>
            The main control panels are located on the left side of the GUI&#39;s main window.
            You use the control panels to operate the GUI.
            Some portions of the control panels may be enabled or disabled depending on the
            GUI&#39;s configuration or current state.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following table lists the main control panels, and summarizes their functions.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
            <tr>
                <th align="center" valign="top">Control&nbsp;Panel</th>

                    Loads data into the GUI.
                    Data can come from Comcat, from a catalog file, or from a forecast download file.
                    The data consists of a mainshock and its associated foreshocks and aftershocks.

                    After setting parameters, you can fit the model parameters and compute forecasts.

        <p><b>Floating Panel Design</b></p>
        <p>
            Many of the buttons on the main control panels open secondary control panels
            that offer additional functions.
            These secondary control panels &quot;float&quot; in front of the main window.
            You can move them around if they obscure a portion of the main window that you want to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most cases, you can continue to interact with the main window while a secondary
            control panel is open.
            In particular, you can open more secondary control panels,
            so it is possible to have several secondary control panels open at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The floating panel design lets you have open the control panels that you want to use,
            while other control panels remain hidden away.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Help Viewer</b></p>
        <p>
            The GUI includes a help viewer that displays built-in help pages.
            There are three ways to open the help viewer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Most control panels have a button in the upper right corner that is labeled with a question mark.
                Pressing that button opens the help viewer and displays a page of help text for that control panel.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a <b>Help Topics</b> button on the GUI&#39;s main window.
                Pressing that button opens the help viewer and displays a page of links to
                help on various topics.
                In particular, there is help for all of the result windows that appear on
                the right side of the GUI&#39;s main window.
                There is also help for the command-line options that the GUI supports.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a <b>Help</b> button in the forecast table.
                Pressing that button opens the help viewer and displays a page of help
                for the forecast table and related controls.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The help viewer &quot;floats&quot; in front of the main window.
            You can move it around if it obscures a portion of the main window that you want to see.
            You can keep the help viewer open while interacting with the main window
            and with the secondary control panels.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the bottom of the help viewer there are buttons labeled with left and right arrows.
            You can use these buttons to navigate backward and forward among the help pages
            that you have viewed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the help pages have links that you can click to view related pages.
            After clicking a link, you can press the back button to return to the original page.
