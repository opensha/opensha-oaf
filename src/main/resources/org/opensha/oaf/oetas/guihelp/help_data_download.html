        <h2>Data Source Options: Download File</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you select options for loading a download file (forecast_data.json)
            into the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mainshock event ID comes from the mainshock information that is within the download file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI loads the earthquake catalog that is contained within the download file.
            Also, forecast parameters in the GUI are initialized to the parameter values in the download file
            that were used to create the forecast.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Download Filename<br>Browse Download File</b></p>
        <p>
            Use these controls to select a disk file.
            You can type the filename into the text box,
            or you can click the <b>Browse</b> button to open a file chooser dialog.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Call Comcat for mainshock</b></p>
        <p>
            If this box is checked then, in addition to loading mainshock information from within
            the download file, the GUI also calls Comcat to obtain updated information about the mainshock.
            The updated information is primarily information used to send forecasts to PDL.
            This does not alter the time, magnitude, or location of the mainshock that is
            inside the download file.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Data Start Time<br>Data End Time</b></p>
        <p>
            These are read-only fields.
            When a download file is loaded, these fields are set to the start and end times of the
            earthquake catalog that is contained within the file, expressed as days since the mainshock.
            The start time can be negative, to indicate that the catalog includes
            foreshocks which occur before the mainshock.
