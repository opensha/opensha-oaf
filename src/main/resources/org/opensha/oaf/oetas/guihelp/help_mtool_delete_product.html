        <h2>Delete Product</h2>
        <p>
            This panel lets you delete the OAF product for the current earthquake from Comcat.
            Optionally, it can also delete or modify the event-sequence product for the current earthquake.
        </p>
        <p>
            This function works by sending commands directly to PDL.
            It does not contact the AAFS servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The panel becomes active when you load data into the GUI.
            (If you load data from a catalog file then you need to check the <b>Call Comcat for mainshock</b>
            chackbox in order for this panel to be active.)
            The functions in this panel do not require that you fit parameters or compute a forecast;
            all that is needed is a mainshock.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Event-Sequence Option<br>Cap Time</b></p>
        <p>
            Use the drop-down list to select whether you want to delete or modify the event-sequence product
            for the current earthquake.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Delete</i> - If the current earthquake has an event-sequence product, it is deleted.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Ignore</i> - If the current earthquake has an event-sequence product, it is <b>not</b> deleted or modified.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Cap End Time</i> - If the current earthquake has an event-sequence product,
                then the end time of the sequence is changed.
                This is useful if you are deleting the OAF product because the current earthquake has become a
                foreshock of a leter, larger earthquake.
                In this case, you may want to set the end time to be just before the later, larger earthquake.
                Note that this option can only modify an existing event-sequence product,
                it cannot create an event-sequence product if one does not already exist.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The text field becomes active if you choose the <i>Cap End Time</i> option.
            Enter the date and time at which the sequence ends, in UTC.
            It is recommended that you enter the date and time in the form &quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&quot;,
            for example, &quot;2025-04-14 17:08&quot;.
            You can also use <a href="help_entering_date_time.html">other time formats</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These controls are disabled if the GUI is configured to not support event-sequence.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>PDL Delete</b></p>
        <p>
            Deletes the OAF product of the current earthquake by sending a delete command directly to PDL.
        </p>
        <p>
            If selected, also deletes or modifies any existing event-sequence product of the current earthquake,
            by sending commands directly to PDL.
            It is possible to delete or modify an existing event-sequence product even if the current earthquake
            does not have an OAF product.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GUI displays a dialog box for you to comfirm that you want to perform the delete operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the PDL destination is <i>Dry Run</i>, which means that the GUI goes through the motions
            of deleting the OAF product but does not send anything to PDL.
            In order to send commands to PDL, you must use the GUI command line to specify the
            PDL destination and private key file.
