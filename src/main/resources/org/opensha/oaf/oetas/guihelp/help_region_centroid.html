        <h2>Edit Region: Centroid Circle</h2>
        <p>
            This region is a circle whose radius is a specified number of kilometers.
            The center of the circle is determined using the centroid algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The centroid algorithm works by first drawing a circle around the mainshock&#39;s epicenter,
            and finding all the aftershocks that lie within the circle.
            Then, the center of the search region is determined by computing the centroid of the
            epicenters of all those aftershocks plus the mainshock.

        <p><b>Radius</b></p>
        <p>
            The region&#39;s radius, in kilometers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maximum allowed radius is 20,000 km, which is slightly less than 180 degrees of arc.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Min Depth<br>Max Depth</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields contain the minimum and maximum allowed depth of aftershocks and foreshocks, in kilometers.
            Any aftershocks or foreshocks whose depth lies outside this range are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default values are -5.0 and 700.0, which is the largest depth range allowed by OpenSHA.
            It is strongly recommended that you not change these value.
