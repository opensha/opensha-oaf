        <h2>Edit Region: Centroid WC Circle</h2>
        <p>
            This region is a circle whose radius is a multiple of the Wells and Coppersmith rupture length.
            The center of the circle is determined using the centroid algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            The centroid algorithm works by first drawing a circle around the mainshock&#39;s epicenter,
            and finding all the aftershocks that lie within the circle.
            Then, the center of the search region is determined by computing the centroid of the
            epicenters of all those aftershocks plus the mainshock.
        </p>

        <p><b>WC Multiplier</b></p>
        <p>
            The region&#39;s radius is equal to the value of this field multiplied by the
            Wells and Coppersmith rupture length.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if the value of this field is 1.0 then the radius is equal to the
            Wells and Coppersmith rupture length. If it is 2.0 then the radius is double the
            Wells and Coppersmith rupture length, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Min Radius<br>Max Radius</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields contain the minimum and maximum allowed radius of the region, in kilometers.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Min Depth<br>Max Depth</b></p>
        <p>
            These fields contain the minimum and maximum allowed depth of aftershocks and foreshocks, in kilometers.
            Any aftershocks or foreshocks whose depth lies outside this range are ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default values are -5.0 and 700.0, which is the largest depth range allowed by OpenSHA.
            It is strongly recommended that you not change these value.
