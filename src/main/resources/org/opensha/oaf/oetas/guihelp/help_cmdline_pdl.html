        <h2>Command Line: PDL Configuration</h2>
        <p>
            These command line options control how the GUI communicates with PDL when it sends products.
            For example, the following command line can be used to tell the GUI to send products
            to the PDL production system.
        </p>
<pre>
java -jar AftershockGUI-2026_01_06.jar --pdl=prod --privateKey=mykeyfile
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, the <code>--pdl</code> option specifies that products should be sent to the production PDL system,
            and the <code>--privateKey</code> option specifies the digital key file that is used to sign products.
            Note that the name of the GUI jar file may be different than shown.
        </p>
        <p>
            PDL configuration options are described in detail below.
            All PDL configuration options are optional; if omitted, then the GUI supplies defaults.
        </p>
        <p>
            Options may appear in the command line in any order.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--pdl=dryrun
--pdl=dev
--pdl=prod
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--pdl</code> option selects the destination when sending PDL products. It can have the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>dryrun</i> - Nothing is sent to PDL, but the GUI &quot;goes through the motions&quot; of sending products.</li>
            <li><i>dev</i> - Send products to the PDL staging system.</li>
            <li><i>prod</i> - Send products to the PDL production system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that not all versions of the GUI are able to send products to the PDL staging system.
            If the GUI does not support sending products to PDL staging, then <i>dev</i> effectively behaves the same as <i>dryrun</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            if the <code>--pdl</code> option is omitted, the default is <i>dryrun</i>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--privateKey=PRIVATEKEYFILE
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--privateKey</code> option specifies the name of a file that contains a digital key.
            The key is used to digitally sign products.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the <code>--privateKey</code> option is omitted, the default is to send products unsigned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PDL production system requires that products be signed.
            Older versions of the PDL staging system accepted unsigned products, but newer versions require that products be signed.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--target=socket
--target=aws
--target=both
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--target</code> option selects the PDL hub and communication protocal used when sending PDL products. It can have the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>socket</i> - Send products to the on-premise PDL hubs using the PDL socket protocol. This is the old way to send products.</li>
            <li><i>aws</i> - Send products to the cloud PDL hubs using the PDL AWS protocol. This is the new way to send products.</li>
            <li><i>both</i> - Send products to both on-premise and cloud PDL hubs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that because the GUI only supports a single key file, the <i>both</i> selection won&#39;t work unless
            both hubs are configured to accept the same digital key.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the <code>--target</code> option is omitted, the GUI supplies a pre-programmed default.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--evseq-config=enable
--evseq-config=disable
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--evseq-config</code> option specifies whether the GUI can generate and send event-sequence products. It can have the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>enable</i> - The GUI can generate and send event-sequence products.</li>
            <li><i>disable</i> - The GUI cannot generate and send event-sequence products.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note that if the OAF server does not support event-sequence products, you cannot make the server generate event-sequence products
            by enabling event-sequence in the GUI and then sending parameters to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            if the <code>--evseq-config</code> option is omitted, the GUI supplies a pre-programmed default.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--source=PRODUCTSOURCE
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--source</code> option identifies the seismic network (or equivalent) that is the originator of products sent to PDL by the GUI.
            The default value is &quot;us&quot;, which is the network code for the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC).
            For example, <code>--source=us</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the digital key used to sign PDL products must be authorized for use with the specified seismic network.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
--type=PRODUCTTYPE
</pre>
        <p>
            The <code>--type</code> option specifies the type of PDL product that the GUI uses to send aftershock forecasts to PDL.
            The default value is &quot;oaf&quot;, which uses the standard operational aftershock forecast product.
            For example, <code>--type=oaf</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can use &quot;oaf-scenario&quot; to send aftershock forecasts for an earthquake scenario exercise.
            For example, <code>--type=oaf-scenario</code>.
            There is no way to send an event-sequence product for an earthquake scenario,
            so if you use <code>--type=oaf-scenario</code> then you should also use <code>--evseq-config=disable</code> (this does not happen automatically).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the digital key used to sign PDL products must be authorized for use with the specified type of product.
