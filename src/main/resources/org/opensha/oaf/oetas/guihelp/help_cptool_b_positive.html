        <h2>Tool: Compute b-value using b-positive</h2>
        <p>
            This tool computes an estimated b-value using the b-positive algoritm
            of van der Elst (2021, JGR Solid Earth).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this tool is a modal dialog, which means that you must close the tool
            before you can use any other part of the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Min Magnitude</b></p>
        <p>
            The b-positive algorithm only considers aftershocks that are at least a certain
            minimum magnitude.
            Use this field to specify the minimum magnitude.
            A value of 0.0 effectively means to use all aftershocks in the catalog.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Min Magnitude Increase</b></p>
        <p>
            The b-positive algorithm searches for pairs of consecutive aftershocks where
            the magnitude of the second aftershock exceeds the magnitude of the first aftershock
            by at least some minimum amount.
            Use this field to specify the minimum amount.
        </p>
        <p>
            The value should be at least twice the precision of the magnitudes in the catalog.
            A typical value is 0.2 or larger.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Compute b-positive</b></p>
        <p>
            Press the button to run the calculation.
            The computed b-value is placed into the <b>b-value</b> field and into the <b>Select</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>b-value</b></p>
        <p>
            This is a read-only field that displays the computed b-value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Select</b></p>
        <p>
            When you compute a b-value, this button becomes active, and the computed
            b-value is inserted into the button.
            Press the button to close the tool and transfer the b-value into the <b>b-value</b>
            field in the <b>Common Parameters</b> panel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Cancel</b></p>
        <p>
            Press this button to close the tool without choosing a new b-value.
