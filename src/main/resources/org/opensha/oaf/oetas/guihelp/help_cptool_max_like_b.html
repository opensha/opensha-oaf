        <h2>Tool: Compute Max Likelihood b-value</h2>
        <p>
            This tool computes an estimated b-value using the maximum likelihood algoritm
            of Aki (1965, Bull. Earthq. Res. Inst.).
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this tool is a modal dialog, which means that you must close the tool
            before you can use any other part of the GUI.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Mc For Sequence</b></p>
        <p>
            Use this field to supply an estimated magnitude of completeness for the
            catalog that has been loaded into the GUI.
            When you open the tool, this field is initialized to the value of <b>Mc For Sequence</b>
            in the <b>Common Parameters</b> panel.
            You can change this value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Magnitude Precision</b></p>
        <p>
            Set this field to the estimated precision of the magnitudes in the catalog.
            A typical value is 0.1.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Compute max likelihood b-value</b></p>
        <p>
            Press the button to run the calculation.
            The computed b-value is placed into the <b>b-value</b> field and into the <b>Select</b> button.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>b-value</b></p>
        <p>
            This is a read-only field that displays the computed b-value.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Select</b></p>
        <p>
            When you compute a b-value, this button becomes active, and the computed
            b-value is inserted into the button.
            Press the button to close the tool and transfer the b-value into the <b>b-value</b>
            field in the <b>Common Parameters</b> panel.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Cancel</b></p>
        <p>
            Press this button to close the tool without choosing a new b-value.
