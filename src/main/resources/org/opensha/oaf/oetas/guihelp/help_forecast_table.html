        <h2>Forecast Table</h2>
        <p>
            This window shows the computed forecasts.
            There can be up to four forecasts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                ETAS.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasenberg-Jones sequence-specific.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasenberg-Jones generic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reasenberg-Jones Bayesian.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Use the tabs at the top of the window to select which forecast you want to view.
            The ETAS forecast, if present, can be either sequence-specific, generic, or Bayesian,
            depending on the option you selected in the <b>ETAS Options</b> panel when
            computing the forecast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The selected forecast is shown in a table at the bottom of the window.
            The table shows forecasts for four time windows: one day, one week, one month, and one year.
            Each time window begins at, or shortly after, the end of the loaded earthquake catalog.
            Normally, this is approximately the current time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each time window, forecasts are shown for several magnitude ranges.
            By default, these are for aftershocks with magnitude at least 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0,
            and the mainshock magnitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each magnitude range, the table shows the expected number of aftershock,
            given as the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval, plus the median.
            The table also shows the probability of one or more aftershocks, given as a percentage.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the center of the window is a set of controls that you can use to perform
            the following functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Save the forecast to a file.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send the forecast to PDL.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the advisory duration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select the OAF product template.
            </li>
            <li>
                Specify the time at which the next forecast will be issued.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The controls are described in detail below.
            Note that there are additional controls in the <b>Analyst Parameters</b> panel that you
            can use to perform the following additional functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Enter injectable text.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter an analyst remark.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set options for the event-sequence product.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Export Forecast to File</b></p>
        <p>
            Lets you save the forecast to a file, in the form of a forecast_data.json file.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you enter the filename.
        </p>
        <p>
            The saved file contains all the forecasts shown in this window,
            plus the advisory duration, the template, the time of next forecast,
            the mainshock information, the aftershock search region,
            the magnitude of completeness parameters, all the forecast parameters, the event-sequence options,
            the injectable text and analyst remark (if any), and the earthquake catalog.
            The forecast that is currently displayed in this window is considered to be the selected forecast.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can later send the saved forecast to PDL using the <b>File Operations</b> panel.
            If you do, the selected forecast (that is, the forecast that is displayed in this window at the
            time the file is saved) is the forecast that will appear on the event page.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Send Forecast to PDL</b></p>
        <p>
            Lets you send the forecast to PDL.
            When you click this button, a dialog box opens asking you to confirm that you want to
            send the forecast to PDL.
            The forecast that is currently displayed in this window (that is, the selected forecast)
            is the forecast that will appear on the event page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike with earlier versions of the GUI, the forecast will include both forecast.json
            and forecast_data.json files.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the event-sequence options (set in the <b>Analyst Parameters</b> panel) specify that
            an event-sequence product should be sent,
            then clicking this button also sends the event-sequence product.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, the PDL destination is <i>Dry Run</i>, which means that the GUI goes through the motions
            of sending the OAF and event-sequence products but does not send anything to PDL.
            In order to send products to PDL, you must use the GUI command line to specify the
            PDL destination and private key file.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Advisory Duration</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down list lets you set the aftershock forecast advisory duration.
            The possible durations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>1 Day</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>1 Week</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>1 Month</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>1 Year</i>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The default advisory duration depends on how long ago the mainshock occurred.
            It is recommended that the <i>1 Day</i> duration should not be used.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Template</b></p>
        <p>
            This drop-down list lets you set the OAF product template.
            The possible templates are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Mainshock</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Earthquake of Interest</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Swarm</i>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It is strongly recommended that you leave the template set to <i>Mainshock</i>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Next Forecast<br>Next Forecast Time</b></p>
        <p>
            These controls let you specify when the next forecast will be issued.
            This drop-down list offers the following choices.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Not Specified</i> - No information about the next forecast is provided.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Unknown</i> - Specifies that the next forecast will occur at an unknown time.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>None</i> - Specifies that there will be no further forecasts.<br>&nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Set Time</i> - Indicates that the next forecast is scheduled to occur at about the specified time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you select <i>Set Time</i>, then the text box is activated.
            Enter the date and time at which the next forecast is scheduled to occur, in UTC.
            It is recommended that you enter the date and time in the form &quot;yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm&quot;,
            for example, &quot;2025-04-14 17:08&quot;.
            You can also use <a href="help_entering_date_time.html">other time formats</a>.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Export forecast.json</b></p>
        <p>
            Lets you save the currently-selected forecast to a file, in the form of a forecast.json file.
            When you click this button, a file chooser opens to let you enter the filename.
        </p>
        <p>
            The saved file contains only the one forecast that is currently displayed in this window.
            It also contains the advisory duration, the template, the time of next forecast,
            and the injectable text (if any) from the <b>Analyst Parameters</b> panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can later send the saved forecast.json file to PDL using the <b>File Operations</b> panel.
