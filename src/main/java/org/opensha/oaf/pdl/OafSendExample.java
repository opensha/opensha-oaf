/**
 * This class provides a simple example of generating and sending a product.
 * A product is a bundle of information including properties (key-value pairs)
 * as well as contents (files/blobs). Read more about products here:
 *
 * http://ehppdl1.cr.usgs.gov/userguide/products/index.html
 *
 * This example is generalized for how to send products programmatically and
 * does not reflect the expected properties or contents that might need to be
 * added to an actual OAF product.
 *
 * ```
 * Final OAF product properties, contents and structure requires discussion.
 * ```
 *
 * For OAF, there are currently three types of products that the event pages
 * will look for:
 *
 * 1) type = "oaf"
 *      This is the primary OAF product and should include forecast
 *      information. This product is used to generate the forecast table and
 *      fill in the boilerplate text on the OAF section of the event page. This
 *      product must be sent in order to generate an OAF section on the event
 *      page.
 *
 * 2) type = "oaf-header"
 *      This product allows free-form introductory text to be added to the
 *      top of the OAF section of the event page (above the tabs). No special
 *      styling is applied to this product when rendered, but the product
 *      content (inline only) may be set to use a type of "text/html" to allow
 *      for some simple styling.
 *      See: http://ehppdl1.cr.usgs.gov/userguide/products/text.html
 *
 * 3) type = "oaf-link"
 *      This product allows for links to be added to the OAF section of the
 *      event page. A link is probably added in order to direct visitors to
 *      additional information, like local emergency reponse organizations.
 *      See: http://ehppdl1.cr.usgs.gov/userguide/products/link.html
 *
 * We can discuss if additional product types are necessary, as well as discuss
 * the final form for the base "oaf" product type in order to ensure the
 * OAF section on the event page can be generated as desired.
 *

 *  - Email: "Eric Martinez" <emartinez@usgs.gov>
