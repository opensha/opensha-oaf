/**
 * Time-dependent magnitude of completeness function.
 * Author: Michael Barall 11/09/2018.
 *
 * This abstract class represents a time-dependent magnitude of completeness
 * function.  It is time-dependent because, immediately following an earthquake,
 * the catalog's magnitude of completeness is higher than in normal times.
 *
 * Objects of this class, and its subclasses, are immutable and stateless.
 * They are pure functions, which means that their outputs depend only on the
 * supplied values of tDays (time since the origin in days), magMain (mainshock
 * magnitude), and magCat (magnitude of completeness in normal times).
 *
 * There are methods to calculate magComp (the magnitude of completeness) and
 * tComp (the time of completeness).  Considered as a function of time, magComp
 * must satisfy the following conditions:
 *
 * 1. magComp is a continuous, monotone decreasing function.
 *
 * 2. For times t >= tComp, magComp equals magCat.  (If magComp never equals magCat,
 * say, because it approaches magCat exponentially, it is acceptable to set tComp
 * equal to a very large value.)
 *
 * 3. For times epsilon < t < tComp, magComp is a smooth function with derivatives
 * of all orders.  Here, epsilon is some very small value, typically the smallest
 * positive normalized floating-point value.  (The purpose of this rule is to ensure
 * that numerical integration of the aftershock rate is well-behaved.)
 *
 * 4. For times 0 <= t <= epsilon, magComp is constant and equal to its maximum
 * value.  (Note that magComp must have a finite value at t == 0).
 *
 * Considered as a function of magCat, magComp must satisfy the following condition:
 *
 * 5. If magCat1 > magCat2, then magComp(magCat1) = max(magComp(magCat2), magCat1).
 * (The purpose of this rule is to properly account for cases where earthquakes
 * detected by the seismic network are not available from Comcat unless they
 * exceed a magnitude threshold (which could be our Comcat search magnitude).
 * This is most easily achieved by choosing magComp to have the form
 * magComp(magMain, magCat, tDays) = max(F(magMain, tDays), magCat)
 * where F is some function that depends only on magMain and tDays.)
