/**
 * Holder for database record payload.
 * Author: Michael Barall 04/08/2018.
 *
 * In the AAFS server, some database records hold a payload, which the user can
 * access by marshaling and unmarshaling.  This object holds a payload in the
 * form that it is stored in the database.  It can be used to transfer a payload
 * from one record to another.  It implements MarshalWriter so it can be passed
 * in to the same routines that are used to supply marshaled data.

 *
 * Only code very close to the database engine should create these objects or
 * access their contents.  All other code should treat these objects as opaque.
 * (If this was C++, everything would be private and the classes that need access
 * would be friends, but Java does not have an analogous mechanism.)
